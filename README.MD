Hi. If you wannted to use Huggingface models in Ollama here's how.

You need to have Ollama.


First get the GGUF file of your desired model.

Next create a Modelfile.

**FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEW**
I've shown how to do this here:





















Install vs code, or vscode portable.

https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Now find the correct .zip / .tar.gz file for your platform.

Install
Go throught the setup you do not need much you can skip throught most of it.

Now open new folder, choose where you'd like the modelfile to be.

on the right click New File, and name it "Modelfile".

Below on the right hand side you will see, terminal. 

Type: **"ollama show llama3.1 --modelfile"**
> This is the one that comes installed WITH ollama.
